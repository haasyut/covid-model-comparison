# Comparative Analysis of ARIMA and SEIR Models Using COVID-19 Data

This project compares the forecasting performance of two time series modelsâ€”ARIMA and SEIRâ€”on real-world COVID-19 case data. Implemented in R, the analysis explores how statistical and compartmental models behave under the same dataset and forecasting horizon.

## Project Structure

- `report.Rmd`: R Markdown source of the analysis
- `report.html`: Rendered interactive report
- `data/`: Raw COVID-19 case data

## Highlights

- ARIMA model built using auto.arima()
- SEIR model calibrated via differential equations
- Forecast evaluation over multiple regions and horizons
- Interactive plots and comparison tables

## ðŸš€ Quick Preview

See `report.html` for full results and figures.
